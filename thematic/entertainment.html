        Shopping:
          Shopping is an essential part in a travel. In the four cities I’ve been. London is the best place to go shopping. I had been to Oxford Street and Covent Garden. Both of them have a lot of stores to shop. You can find something cheaper in Taiwan. Also, these two places have some souvenir stores. If you want to buy gifts for your friends. You can choose there. There is one souvenir I ‘d like to recommend. That is the tea and hot cocoa and my favorite store is Whittard. Whittard has already opened in Taiwan, but you can get better price in the UK.

      Free tour:
        The best experience there is the free tour. I attended three free tours in London, Oxford and Cambridge and all are worthwhile. The tourist guides took us to the attractions one by one and introduced the histories and stories to us. I knew more about those places because of the tourist guides. There will be the other tours which need some costs. But, it is possible to find tour for free. And, I am sure that their tour guides are great, too. Therefore, I think joining a free tour is a thing you must do in the UK.

          Museums & Attractions:
        First, British Museum is an important place to go. There are plenty of exhibition there and it is impossible to visit completely in several hours. You can see a lot of interesting and ancient items. The best thing is that it is free for entry. If you want to know more you can pay for an audio guide. Second, you can go to Buckingham Palace to see the ceremonial change of guards. One thing you need to notice is that you should arrive earlier because there would be a lot of people waiting. If you are late, you will miss a place with good view. In addition to the above, some famous places like London Eyes, London Bridge and Big Ben is good to take a picture. But, these place are usually in a repair time. Whether you can see or not, it depends on your fortune.
