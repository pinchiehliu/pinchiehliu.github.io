			<h1> Autobiography
		</h1>
		<section>
			My name is Pin-Chieh Liu. I am a college student in the department of foreign languages and literature at National Tsing Hua University. I was born in Taichung, where is also my favorite city for the weather.

			I am an independent person because of my growth environment. My home is located in the countryside which forced me to live by myself in a house close to my senior high school. It took me little time to practice living alone. In my spree time, l will play a variety of instruments. With the eight-year experience of playing the piano, I can be easier to learn other instruments, such as violin, ukulele and guitar. But, I am poor at singing. Even though I practice a lot, I am still easy to be out of tune.

			Being a person who likes to makes friends, I have participated in various activities in my college life. As a member in the student association of the department, I played different roles in various activities because I can cooperate with different people. Every time I finish an activity, I will get a great sense of accomplishment. These activities make me figure out my ability in different areas.

			In a nutshell, I am a person who dares to try things I am not familiar with. I won’t be afraid of jumping out of my comfort zone. Instead, I feel curious about special things. And, I hope myself to be a person who dares to dream and be creative.
