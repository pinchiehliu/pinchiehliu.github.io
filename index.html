			<h1> Autobiography
		</h1>
		<section>
			My name is Pin-Chieh Liu. I am a college student in the department of foreign languages and literature at National Tsing Hua University. I was born in Taichung, where is also my favorite city for the weather.

			I am an independent person because of my growth environment. My home is located in the countryside of Taichung far from the downtown area which forced me to live by myself in a house close to my senior high school. It took me little time to practice living alone. In my spree time, I like to play a variety of instruments because I love music. I had learned the piano for about eight years. Thanks to the experience of playing the piano, I can be easier to learn other instruments, such as violin, ukulele and guitar. I enjoy the time with music. But, I am poor at singing. Even though I practice a lot, I am still easy to be out of tune.

			I enjoy my college life very much. Being a person who like to makes friends, I have participated in various activities. Also, I was a member in of the student association of the department and guitar club. In these activities, I tried to play different roles because I can cooperate with different people to grow my communication skills. Although I faced some difficulties in these activities, I could learn a lot through the difficulties. Every time I finish an activity, I will get a great sense of accomplishment. I really love my college life because I can try anything I am interested in and figure out my ability of different area.

			In a nutshell, I am a person who is brave to try things I am not familiar with. I won’t be afraid of jumping out of my comfort zone. Instead, I feel curious about special things. And, I hope myself to be a person who dare to dream and be creative.
