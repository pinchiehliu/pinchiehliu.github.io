			<h1> About Me
		</h1>
		<section>
			My name is Pin-Chieh Liu. I am a college student in the department of foreign languages and literature at National Tsing Hua University. I was born in Taichung, where is also my favorite city for the weather.

			I am an independent person because of my growth environment. My home is located in the countryside which forced me to live by myself in a house close to my senior high school. It took me little time to practice living alone. In my spare time, l will play a variety of instruments. With the eight-year experience of playing the piano, I can be easier to learn other instruments, such as violin, ukulele and guitar. But, I am poor at singing. Even though I practice a lot, I am still easy to be out of tune.

			Being a person who likes to makes friends, I have participated in various activities in my college life. As a member in the student association of the department, I played different roles in various activities because I can cooperate with different people. Every time I finish an activity, I will get a great sense of accomplishment. These activities make me figure out my ability in different areas.

			In a nutshell, I am a person who dares to try things I am not familiar with. I won’t be afraid of jumping out of my comfort zone. Instead, I feel curious about special things. And, I hope myself to be a person who dares to dream and be creative.

			我是劉品婕，是一個台中人，目前大四，就讀於國立清華大學外國語文學系。高中時學校離家很遠，所以從那時候就自己外宿在學校附近，也因而培養我獨立自主的個性，平常有空時，我喜歡玩玩樂器，除了學了八年的鋼琴，我也嘗試過小提琴、烏克麗麗和吉他，很享受音樂帶給我的輕鬆快樂，但是，我十分不擅長唱歌，無論怎麼練習，還是會不斷地走音。而在大學期間，我參加了各式各樣的活動、結交不同的朋友，我也曾擔任系學會活動股長一職，並在不同的活動中扮演不同的角色，每當完成一個活動，成就感給我很大的感動，我也能透過活動，找出自己適合的角色與強項。我喜歡嘗試新鮮的事物，很努力想跳出自己的舒適圈，而我也期許自己能更勇敢去追求想要的事物。
